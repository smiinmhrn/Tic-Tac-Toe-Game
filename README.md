# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This game is very popular and is fairly simple
There are a few differences with the classical one:

• The board is square with 16 cells (4*4)

• Some cells will be randomly locked (no player can use these cells)

• The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same
symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

• Up to 2 players can play simultaneously. (For single player, the other
player can be an AI). There are two options for players:

o Human

o Computer

For the option human, both the players are human and for the option
computer, the first player is human and the second player is computer.
Player 1 as 'X' and player 2 as 'O' enter their moves in each step.

• there are only three possible results:

o a player wins

o his opponent (human or computer) wins

o it’s a tie! (For equal or impossible score)

For example:

Player 1 : X

Player 2 : O
